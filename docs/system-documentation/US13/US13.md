### 3.1. Rationale

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for...       | Answer                         | Justification (with patterns)                                                                                   |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Step 1         | ... interacting with the actor?                   |      | **Pure Fabrication**: There is no reason to assign this responsibility to any existing class in the Domain Model. |
|                | ... coordinating the user story?                  |  | **Controller**: Mediates between the view and the model.                                                        |
| Step 2         | ... requesting data?                              |   | IE: is responsible for user interactions.                                                                       |
| Step 3         | ... types the requested data?                     |                         | Creator (Rule 1): in the DM Admin                                                       |
| Step 4         | ... showing all data and requesting confirmation? |       | IE: is responsible for user interactions.                                                                       |
| Step 5         | .. instantiating a new vaccine type?              |                          | Creator (Rule 1): in the DM Person                                                      |
| 			  		 | ... knowing the VaccineTypeContainer?             |                         | IE: Admin knows the to which it is delegating some responsibilities.                       |
|                | ... validating all data?                          |          | IE: knows all its                                                                                  |
|                | ... saving the new vaccine type?                  |           | IE: owns all its                                                                               |
| Step 6         | ... informing the operation sucess?               |                  | IE: is responsible for user interactions.                                                                       |

### Systematization

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:
